## A Cookbook (A Recipe Hub)

The web application is a cookbook which will contain recipes allowing users 
to view the recipes or to add their own recipes. This application conveniently 
organizes the recipes in different cuisines and different cooking methods. 
Also, the application will allow users to enter the ingredients they wish 
to cook with, and they will be matched  with recipe(s) that requires the 
least amount of additional ingredients. Moreover, the application will 
allow users to determine the popularity of a recipe through ratings 
which will be provided with each. 

There are two main categories of users for this application:

**1. Those looking for a new recipe**

**2. Those wanting to share a recipe**

The application will particularly appeal to those wanting to try out new recipes with their commonly used ingredients but also appeals
to those just looking for a recipe or cooking enthusiasts wanting to share their 
recipes with others. This application is of particular interest to me, as a student,
who is living independently away from home and looking for ways to creatively 
utilize the ingredients and to break the food monotony.
